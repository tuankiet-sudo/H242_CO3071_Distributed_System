## 1. Setting Up the Kafka Cluster with Docker Compose

To set up the Kafka cluster using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `Lab/` directory.

2. Ensure that the Docker daemon is running. If you're using Docker Desktop, make sure it is actively running.

3. Execute the following command to start the Kafka cluster:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

This will bring up the Kafka cluster with the defined configurations in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
